<p>Imagine a place where anyone can go to find other Makers to collaborate with, share their skills, and create team projects.
That place now exists, and it's called Maker2Maker.

<p>
&quot;It's a great time to be a maker. A growing group of crafty, creative tinkerers, 
and makers around the world have created a movement that is changing the face of industry 
and the economy as we know it. If it can be imagined, it can be made.&quot;

Maker2Maker is a virtual hackerspace and networking site for makers, that is working to build an online collaborative community.
If you live in an urban hub like New York, San Francisco, or here in Portlandia, finding a physical hacker space to join and
other hackers to collaborate with is easy. However, if you live in a more remote region, not so much. 
Providing a virtual networking space for makers was important for Maker2Maker founder, Alex Markus.
We spoke with Alex this week, to inquire about the history and future direction of Maker2Maker.
</p>

<p>
&quot;Over the last few years I have watched the growth of maker culture with considerable interest, 
and have seen a lot of amazing things, from hardware startups to education, 
as well as collaborative makerspaces opening up in cities all across North America. 
However, what I couldn't find was a central resource where makers could -
<ul>
	<li>Discover and meet other like-minded makers 
	<li>Showcase their skills and work
	<li>Market their skills and work
	<li>Locate tools and talent needed to complete their projects
	<li>Create teams and collaborate together on projects
</ul>
and this lead to the creation of <a href="http://maker2maker.com/">Maker2Maker</a>.
My primary goal for creating this online community is to provide a place where anyone 
could go to find makers (whether for collaboration or commissions) or share their own skills with others. 
So far, the user base is still small, but among the <a href="http://maker2maker.com/">Maker2Maker</a> users 
there are already some very talented and interesting people. I believe that everyone should have access 
to makers and to maker education in order to build a better and more sustainable future.&quot;
</p>

<p>
This has also been a central theme here at Pattern&#8203;Agents since our founding, 
and we were pleased to have found another like-minded group that is working to
foster and help the maker community to connect and collaborate. So, we encourage you
to sign up and create a profile at <a href="http://maker2maker.com/">Maker2Maker</a>,
and we hope to have some exciting team projects available there in the coming weeks.
