<p>
 <b>RSVP-SIS</b> defines a Virtual Platform standard for the development of embedded systems using modern System-on-Chip devices.
 Ports are available for a number of different physical platforms, including System-on-Chip (SoC) devices, 
 Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), Application Specific Processors, and other computing devices. 
 Applications developed for the RSVP-SIS API's are portable between any supported physical platforms.

<h3>Why RSVP-SIS?</h3>
  <p>
	Modern configurable System-on-Chip and Field Programmable Gate Array devices, 
        are a blank slate for designers to draw on. However, most systems require 
        several common resources and peripherals in order to present the user with a 
        usable "System Platform" upon which to base an application.
  </p>
  <p>
        Unfortunately, most vendor specific solutions lock you into their "walled garden"
        for development, and make it more difficult to upgrade quickly to the latest offerings.
        RSVP-SIS offers a different paradigm, by defining a Virtual Platform for development
        that allows the easy migration between simulation, verification, and the porting of your
        application to different physical devices, like FPGA's, SoC's, multiprocessors, and more. 
  </p>
  <p>
        The Reference System Virtual Platforms (RSVPs) are designed to provide useful 
        baseline systems with commonly required resources and peripherals, as well as a vendor neutral, 
        portable API to access and control those resources and peripherals.
  </p>
  <p>
        While most semiconductor vendors will provide a baseline "driver" library for their parts, 
        or a configuation tool within their IDE (Integrated Development Environment) to select and configure IP blocks, 
        these tend to be unique, vendor specific, and/or proprietary in nature. It can often take a significant 
        amount of work to port an embedded application from one SOC/Microprocessor family to another.
  </p>
  <p>
        RSVP-SIS is intended to provide a vendor neutral, and device/architecture agnostic set of resources,
        peripherals, and Application Programming Interfaces (API's) with which to access them.
        By providing a common set of resources and API's, embedded applications can be ported more rapidly, 
        and with less code modification or if/def configuration.
