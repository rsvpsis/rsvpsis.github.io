	<H1>RSVP - Reference System Virtual Platform</H1>
    <P>
      Modern configurable System-on-Chip and Field Programmable Gate Array devices,
	  are a blank slate for designers to draw on. 
	  However, most systems require several common resources and peripherals in order
	  to present the user with a usable "System Platform" upon which to base an application.
	<P>
     The initial Reference System Virtual Platforms are designed to provide useful
	 baseline systems with commonly required resources and peripherals, as well as a
	 vendor neutral, portable API to access and control those resources and peripherals.
    <P>
	 While most semiconductor vendors will provide a baseline "driver" library for their parts,
	 or a configuation tool within their IDE (Integrated Development Environment) to
     select and configure IP blocks, these tend to be unique, vendor specific, and/or
	 proprietary in nature. It can often take a significant amount of work to port an
	 embedded application from one SOC/Microprocessor family to another.
	<P>
	 RSVP is intended to provide a vendor neutral, and device/architecture agnostic
	 set of resources, peripherals, and Application Programming Interfaces (API's)
	 with which to access them. 
	<P>
     For example, a typical microprocessor, or microprocessor based SOC system
	 <BR>might contain the following resources and peripherals :
	 <PRE>
     System Platform Components:
     CPU_1  : 8051, ARM Cortex-M0/M3
     WDT_1  : System Watchdog Timer
     WDT_2  : User Watchdog Timer
     CTC_1  : System Timer (SysTick)
     CTC_2  : Sleep Timer (SleepTimer)
     CTC_3  : User Timer (UserTimer)
     RTC_1  : Real Time Clock (RTC)
  
     Communications Interface Components:
     USB_1  : USB UART component
  
     UART_1 : UART Full Duplex
     UART_2 : UART Full Duplex
  
     I2C_1  : Slave I2C
     I2C_1  : Master I2C
  
     SPI_1  : Slave SPI
     SPI_2  : Master SPI
  
     Analog Interface Components :
     DAC_1  : Digital to Analog Converter (8bit @50 Ksmp/sec)
     ADC_1  : Analog to Digital COnverter (8bit @50 Ksmp/sec)
  
     User Interface Components:
     DSW_1  : Digital Switch/GPIO Input
     LED_1  : Digital LED/GPIO Output
     LCD_1  : Character Display (16 char x 2 char)
    </PRE>
	<P>
	 By providing a common set of resources and API's, embedded applications can be ported more rapidly,
	 with less code modification.
	<P>

     If you are interested in a taking a look at the initial 
	 <BR>“Reference System Virtual Platform” series that we're working on, 
	 <BR>the "Typical" Platform is coming here soon.</a>
